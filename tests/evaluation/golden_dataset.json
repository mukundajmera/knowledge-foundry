            "expected_answer": "The circuit breaker tracks consecutive LLM API failures. After 5 failures, it opens (blocks requests for 60 seconds). After timeout, it enters half-open state allowing one test request. A success closes the circuit; a failure reopens it. This prevents cascading failures.",
